# weather-forecast
A python program to send us alert sms if the rain is predicted during the day. It can be automated and run daily in the morning on the cloud (e.g python anywhere).
It uses open weather api to check if it is raining at our location in the next 12 hours.
If rain is predicted, it sends us an SMS using twilio api.
